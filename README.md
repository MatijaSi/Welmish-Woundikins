# Welmish-Woundikins
Made using Ruby and BearLibTerminal library.

### Installation:
You will need to have one of the newer versions of Ruby installed and fiddle and rbconfig gems.
Simply put all files into one directory and put the font file (terminus12x12.png) into fonts subdirectory.

Then run in terminal: ruby main.rb

### Controls:
Nethack keys to move.

### Implemented:
Simple map generator, simple combat.

### Goals:
A story heavy and atmospheric roguelike. To add to replayability the story will be procedurally generated. Atmosphere will be mostly present through short descriptions of creatures, map features... (these will also be generated).
